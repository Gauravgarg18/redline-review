            BMW 6 Series GT: Pros, Cons & Should You Buy One?
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            Luxury cars still have a distinct appeal and in the past decade, more and more people have taken the plunge and brought one home.
            Most opt for sedans or SUVs, so the BMW 6 Series GT comes across as a very unusual choice. Exactly what needs does the 6GT satisfy and
            is it a car you didn’t know is the perfect fit for you? Or are you better off sticking with the more commonly chosen alternatives for the same 
            price?

            You probably aren’t in the mood for a long read, so here’s a look at the pros and cons of this BMW grand tourer:

        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            The 6 Series GT is based on the BMW 5 Series but the layman wouldn’t be able to make a connection between the two. 
            The GT has a fastback-like design and has notably larger proportions than the sedan it’s based on.

        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            While this is no sports car, it certainly isn’t a slouch, with even the least powerful version managing the 0-100kmph sprint in under 8 seconds.
            It even gets launch control with the petrol and M Sport diesel! More importantly, it balances this sprightly performance with great ride comfort 
            thanks to adaptive suspension on both axles as standard. In fact, the focus on comfort is greater here than in the 5 Series and even the drive
            modes are an indication of that.
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            The GT puts its unusual shape to good use, enabling a greater amount of cabin space than the 5 Series. There’s a very easily noticeable surplus of headroom, 
            leg room and shoulder room here, which lets even taller owners stretch out. This is also where it comes across as an easy upgrade.
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            Grand tourers aren’t supposed to offer just good cruising performance and comfort, they also need to hold more luggage. 
            The 6 Series GT has over 600 litres of boot space and the rear seats are split folding to liberate even more storage room. 
            In fact, with the rear seat folded, there’s enough space for someone 6.5ft tall to lay down! Given the design, the 
            rear windshield and boot lid open as a single piece, so you can load larger items with ease too.
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            A long cruise can get boring without the right toys to play with. Features in the 6 Series GT include auto headlamps & wipers, soft close doors, 
            a powered tailgate, configurable ambient lighting, 4 zone climate control, gesture controls, a panoramic sunroof and more.

        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        While the 6 Series GT’s styling is certainly unconventional (at least in the Indian market), it may not be to everyone’s taste.
        Sedan buyers prefer a low slung, sporty and sleek stance, while SUV buyers like strong road presence and bulk. 
        The 6 Series GT is somewhere in between both worlds and may seem a bit risky for traditional luxury car buyers. 
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        While the 5-Series doesn’t match the 6 GT for rear seat space or comfort, it certainly does well as a chauffeur driven/family car for four.
        However, when you’re looking to have some fun, it’s the 5 Series that offers the sportier drive experience. 
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        There’s less body roll, the chassis is more precise and it is slightly quicker too. So choosing the 6 GT over the 5 Series is 
        a decision mainly driven by the need for better space and comfort.
