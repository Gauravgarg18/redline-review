            Ford EcoSport Quick Review
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            The Ford EcoSport has a youthful air about it and there’s a sporty vibe to the cabin as well. It’s particularly nice to see 
            how solidly everything feels put together. However, drivers don’t get the best of views out and the thick A-pillars can be 
            bothersome at crossroads. At the rear, comfort is fine but space is down on rivals – and not everyone will be a fan of the 
            EcoSport’s side-opening tailgate.
            The Ford EcoSport’s 123hp, 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine is refined, peppy and likeable. While the standard fit 5-speed manual
            gearbox isn’t the slickest, the torque converter auto is smooth. As for the diesel, Ford’s 100hp, 1.5-litre engine works really well on 
            the EcoSport. It’s not the quietest engine but the linear power delivery makes it an easy one to live with.
            The EcoSport distinguishes itself among compact SUVs for its keen handling. The suspension is absorbent too but variants with larger wheels 
            do ride with a degree of firmness.
