            Ford EcoSport Quick Review
        </div>
        <div style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            It's just six months since the thoroughly updated Ford EcoSport was launched, but the manufacturer is clearly not one to rest on its laurels. There's a new range topper in the EcoSport family now, dubbed the EcoSport S. The S sports minor cosmetic tweaks inside out along with a sunroof, but the bigger news is under the hood. The EcoSport S brings the famed 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine back along with an all-new six-speed manual gearbox. What is it like to drive? Read on to find out. The EcoSport S is based on the Titanium+ variant and is the new top of the line variant. Exterior changes include a blackened grille, smoked HID headlights and black inserts for the fog lamps which lend the SUV a more upmarket look. The EcoSport S also gets redesigned, sportier looking 17-inch alloy wheels. Another important addition is the introduction of a sunroof which does a lot in elevating the upmarket feel. The entire roof and roof rails also get a gloss black finish now to go with the sunroof.Updates to the interiors include orange accents on the seats, door panels as also the dashboard which goes well with the all-black theme. I also liked the fact that Ford has cleverly used part leather and part fabric seat covers in the EcoSport S. The steering wheel also gets orange stitching, while looks nice. Ford has revised the instrument cluster design as well and the clocks certainly look a lot more appealing and modern now. The instrument cluster also integrates a new, larger 4.2-inch multi information display which includes a tyre pressure monitoring system too. The EcoSport S continues using the same 8.0-inch touchscreen display for the infotainment system as before. The screen is a delight to use with its crisp resolution and excellent touch sensitivity and not to forget, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The three cylinder, 1.0-litre turbocharged EcoBoost petrol engine makes a comeback in the EcoSport S. Outputs have not changed and the engine offers 125PS and 170Nm just like before. The EcoBoost comes mated to a new six-speed gearbox this time, and fifth and sixth gears are overdrive. The three pot motor builds revs quickly and there isn't much turbo lag to say so. The EcoSport S thus feels quick, whether taking off from standstill or accelerating through gears.
